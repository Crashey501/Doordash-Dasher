# Doordash-Dasher
The 'dasher_delivery_information (CLEANED)' is a dataset generated from Doordash Dasher App using the 'Request Account Data' function
This is from the period of 9/23/22 - 11/21/22
Additional information such as the Base_Pay, Peak_Pay, Tip, & Total_Take_Home pay were manually inputted from the app
Three Queries were generated to showcase my prowess on SQL.
Upon opening Query 1 There is three Data Updates to make to remove null values
--Query 1: Which was the highest grossing store?
--Query 2: What was the lowest tip for October?
--Query 3: Which day were the most orders delievered?
